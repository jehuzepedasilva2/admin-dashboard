* Check out some color palettes from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).
* All of the icons and more can be downloaded as SVGs from [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/).

(You may want to review the [More Text Styles Lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-more-text-styles) for information about how to include external fonts in your projects).
